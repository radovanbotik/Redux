				Redux Toolkit

#Install:

Option #1:
npx create-react-app my-app --template redux
-init CRA + boilerplate for Redux

			
Option #2:
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
	#Consists of libraries:
	1.redux		-	Core library, state managment
	2.immer		-	Allows to mutate state
	3.redux-thunk	-	Handles async actions
	4/reselect		-	Simplifies reducer functions

##Extras:

redux devtools
combine reducers

##react-redux :
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit ||react-redux||
we need to install this part in order to connect our app to redux

##Setup Store:
Think of store as a state for your entire application.
(similiar to context api)

1.Create store.js somewhere in src folder
2.import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit' 
	2.1 export const store = configureStore({reducer:{}})

##Setup Provider:
1.Navigate to index.js
2.Import to index.js: import { store } from store folder
3.Import to index.js: import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
4.Wrap Provider / Nest App into Provider and provide store prop
	
<Provider store={store}>
 <App/>
</Provider> 

----------------------------------------------------------------

##Slice Setup
Think of slice as a feature of your app,

1.Create folder features (convention name)
2.Create a file for your feature nameSlice.js
--feature:Cart, file: cartSlice.js	
3.Inside the feature file import createSlice
  import {createSlice} from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
4.const cartSlice = createSlice({name:'cart', initialState})
5.setup initialState = {cartItems:[], amount:0, total:0}
6.export cartSlice.reducer;	

##Inside store.js

1.import cartReducer from './features/cartSlice'
2.make a pointer to cartReducer function inside reducer obj
  export const store = configureStore({
    reducer:{
	cart: cartReducer,
	},
     });  	

------------------------------------------------------------------

##Access data from slice/state

1.Import useSelector hook
	import {useSelector} from 'react-redux'
2.useSelector hook takes callback as a parameter
	and inside this anonymous function we get store
	as parameter which represents entire store state
	useSelector((store)=>{//part of store we want})

	const amount = useSelector((store)=>store.cart.amount)
	const { amount } = useSelector(store => store.cart);

##Functionality with Redux-toolkit:
1.Inside the chosen slice we create reducer property
  on our slice object which is object.
2.In this reducer objecy we can define a method that will
  have an access to state and also action as second arg.
  We are not mutating the state because Immer library
  does it for us in the background.

const cartSlice = createSlice(
{name:'cart',
initialState,
reducers:{
clearCart:(state) => {state.items=[];}
},},
)
3.We export our action
export const { clearCart } = cartSlice.action
4.Import useDispatch in file where we want to include
our functionality
5.Import reducer function we want to use
6.Create new const dispatch and store useDispatch inside
const dispatch = useDispatch();
7.Use dispatch and function, we invoke dispatch with clearCart()
onClick={(e)=>dispatch(clearCart())}

###Returning state
we can return new state from our clearCart and this new
state will OVERWRITE/BECOME the initialState

We are changing items property to be an empty array,
however we also OMIT all the other properties. If we choose this
approach and include only items, we will lose 
all the other properties that exists within the state.
(amount,total,pending...)

reducers:{
clearCart:(state) => return { items:[]}
},

###Accessing action, action.payload
1.Create new method inside reducers obj
reducers:{
removeItem: (state, action) => {
      const itemId = action.payload;
      state.items = state.items.filter(item => item.id !== itemId);
    },
}

2.export it
export const { removeItem } = cartSlice.actions;

3.import it along useDispatch in a file where you want to use it
import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { removeItem } from "../features/cart/cartSlice";

4.use it and pass id as param
<button onClick={() => dispatch(removeItem(id))}>
